            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
SIR ROBERT CLAYTON,
LORD-MAYOR
OF THE
City of London.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Publishing this Sermon, was no easie part of
my Obedience, to your Lordships Commands, and
to the desires of the Court of Aldermen: for
I have no reason to expect it should be so favourably
received, when it is brought under the Eyes and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the World, as when it was first delivered. Since
the good temper the Auditory was in, upon the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of that great Conflagration, made it pass more
acceptably at first hearing, than is to be hoped for upon a
<pb facs="tcp:65703:3"/>
stricter review of it. And some Persons of high worth
and Eminence, have been of late, treated so unsutably,
either to their Merit, or their designs in what they
Preached, that it may justly give such a one as I am,
apprehensions of ill usage, for touching our sores, which
are so tender, that some cannot bear the handling them in
the softest manner.</p>
            <p>But having observed that what I said on these
heads, was not unacceptable to your Lordship, who
are so great a Iudge; I do the more freely adventure on
making it publick. Since the Iustice, Prudence, and
Moderation of your Government, has given your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
so great an Interest in the esteem and affections, not
only of this great City, but of the whole Nation; that
as those who are to succeed you in that high Trust,
will be valued and loved, as they follow the Pattern
you have set them; so there are few things that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
such a Discourse, more, than that I may, by
your Lordships permission, say, it was approved of by
one of so great an understanding, and so Excellent a
temper, as yours is generally known to be.</p>
            <p>God grant this may have some good effect on those that
heard it, or may read it, and that the sad prospect now
before us, may by the mercy of God, upon our unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Repentance, be changed unto a serene and happy
<pb facs="tcp:65703:3"/>
calm: wherein that your Lordship may be a great
Instrument, both in this City, and in the publick
Councels of the Kingdom, is the Earnest Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
               <signed>Your Lordships most humble,
and most Obedient Servant,

pluck'd out of the Burning: Yet have ye
not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O <hi>Israel:</hi> And

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe remembrance of that dismal Day,
which brings us now together, grows
too soon stale and cold; and perhaps
passes rather as a doleful Tale, that we
are to hand down to the next Age, than
as a Subject by which our Repentance
and Humiliation are wrought on. We rather glory in
our Wealth, and the great Splendor of <hi>London</hi> rebuilt, than
are humbled, when we remember how she was laid in
Ashes. The Largeness and Evenness of the Streets, the
Regularity and Beauty of the Houses, the Magnificence
of the Churches, Halls, Gates, the Exchange, the Canal,
the Monument, with the other Glories of the City, do
perhaps so much amuse us; that, seeing now no other
Marks, by which we can know what Places were burnt,
and what escaped that spreading and devouring Flame,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65703:5"/>
but the Meanness of the one, compared to the Pomp of
the other, we are apt to think, Why should so disastrous
a Day be had in such constant remembrance? which might
be more suitable when the Wound was green, the Ashes
and Rubbish were not removed, when the Impression was
deep, and Men were more sensible of their Losses, which
in a Succession of fourteen years, they have either digested,
or being quite broken by them, have made way for new
Inhabitants, that had no share of the former Calamity.
But now it may seem too long, to perpetuate the Memory
of these black Days, and bright Nights, that so many of
you looked on then with amazement, and must still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on with horror.</p>
            <p>Yet if we consider, that, how instrumental soever the
Hand of Hell was in it, certainly the Hand, or rather the
Breath of Heaven was visible, both in spreading it over so
many Regions of this populous City, and in stopping it
of a sudden, when the Fire had executed its Commission;
we cannot but think it fit, after so long an Interval, still to
remember what may be supposed to have bin the procuring
Causes of such an unheard-of Burning, which seems since,
by a sort of Contagion, to have spread into many other
Cities of the Nation: And whereas in former Times, a
Fire that carried away a few Houses was thought dismal;
now except it burn down whole Towns, or Streets at
least, we think it gentle and merciful. If we also reflect
upon the Time when it broke out, that it followed a long
and an unhappy War, and a raging Pestilence, our Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
returning so thick upon us, as <hi>Iob</hi>'s Messengers did;
all these things concurring with the sad and gloomy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
now before us,<note place="margin">Iob 43. 31.</note> 
               <hi>It is surely meet to be said unto God,
I have born Chastisement, I will not offend any more; if I
have done Iniquity, I will do so no more.</hi> And joining that
we have seen and felt, with that which is almost all visibly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65703:5"/>
before us, we must conclude, it is fit to turn to Him, who
did some years ago afflict us so severely, but has since gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us a long Interval of Peace and Plenty, and seems
now to be <hi>bending his Bow, whetting his Sword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
against us the Instruments of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words in the Text, pronounced upon the like
occasion, offer to us, both the Reflection on what is past,
the Consideration of what is present, with the Prospect
of what we may look for. Of which I shall first speak
a little in General, before I apply them.</p>
            <p>This Prophecy was given in Commission to <hi>Amos,</hi> one
of the Herdsmen of <hi>Tekoa,</hi> a Town distant twelve Miles
from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and six from <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> so that he lived
in the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> tho he was sent to the Ten Tribes,
that still continued in the Idolatry of <hi>Ieroboam. Iehu</hi>
having rooted out the <hi>Sidonian</hi> Idolatry of the <hi>Baalim,</hi>
he and his Family, as a Blessing, even upon that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Reformation, reigned over these Tribes 104 Years;
but the Period of it was now near an end, and with it,
of the Peace and Liberty of that Kingdom: For <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>'s
Son, <hi>Zacharias,</hi> reigned only six Months;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Compare</hi> 2 Kin. 10. 36. &amp; 13. 1, 10. &amp; 14. 23.</note> and his
Murderer, <hi>Shallum,</hi> but one Month. <hi>Menahem,</hi> who
conspired against him, reigned ten Years; yet against him
came up the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> the conquering Empire
of that Age; and tho <hi>Menahem</hi> redeemed his present
Quiet, by the Tribute of a Thousand Talents, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
them only a whiles respite. His Son, <hi>Pekahiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kin. 15. 19.</note>
being a wicked Prince, <hi>Pekah</hi> conspired against him, and
killed him, in the second Year of his Reign.<note place="margin">2 Kin. 15 29.</note> Then <hi>Tig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath-Pileser,</hi>
another <hi>Assyrian</hi> King, came, and perhaps
pretended to revenge the Death of <hi>Menahem</hi> their Allie's
Son, and carried away most of the Land of <hi>Galilee</hi> into
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65703:6"/>
Captivity. And the total Captivity of these Tribes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
under their next King.<note place="margin">2 Kin. 17. 6.</note> So that from the Days of
this Prophecy, what by the Revolutions of Government
at home, what by the Impressions the proud <hi>Assyrians</hi>
made on them, they had a Succession of grievous Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which ended in the total Subversion of that State.
And they were so dispersed in their Captivity, that except
some Straglers that might have returned with <hi>Zorobbabel,</hi>
they were never again gathered together; so that it is
now only matter of conjecture what is become of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amos</hi> was one of the last Messengers, that was sent to
invite them to Repentance. God had before spoken to
them in the dismal Language of his Judgments, by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
by the blasting of their Harvest, and binding up
the Clouds, that it did not rain; by such Mildew, and
Vermine, as had consumed all their Fruits, their Vines,
Olives, and Figs; by War, and the Plague, to such a
degree that their Dead were not buried, but lay in the
Fields, to infect the Air, and to offend the Living. <hi>The
Stink of your Camps came into your Nostrils.</hi> Which are
all mentioned in the Verses before my Text. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that some of their Cities had been burnt down by
the Hand of Heaven. Two years after this another Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
came on them, from such an Earthquake, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by <hi>Zechariah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 14. 5.</note> that the People, terrified with it,
thought of flying out of the Land; for this Time being
contemporary to that of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> the Earthquake there
mentioned, which became a Proverb, seems to be the
same spoken of in the first Verse of this Prophecy. So that
this honest Shepherd was called from his Flocks, to see, if
the Simplicity and Plainness of the Man, and of his Stile,
which is the lowest of any of all the Prophets, could
be a Mean to awaken them out out of their Impieties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65703:6"/>
The Sins he accuses them most for, were their <hi>Irreligion,</hi>
desiring to stop the Mouths of the Prophets, saying,
<hi>Prophesy not.</hi> And tho they observed the Returns of their
Festivities, their New-Moons,<note place="margin">chap. 2. 21.</note> and Sabbath-Days; yet
they were weary of them, observing them only for
Forms sake, and longed to have them over. He also
charges them for their <hi>Luxury:</hi>
               <note place="margin">chap. 8. 5.</note> They had rebuilt their
burnt and wasted Cities with hewen Stone, and had
planted pleasant Vineyards and Olive-yards;<note place="margin">chap. 5. 11.</note> they drank
Wine in Bowls, something like Healths now a-days; they
anointed themselves with rich Ointment,<note place="margin">chap. 6, 4, 5, 6</note> had their Beds
of Ivory, and rich Couches about their Tables, feasted
high, and had excellent Musick at their Entertainments,
were guilty of great Iniquity and Oppression, so that
there was no Truth nor Justice among them. And they
were become so bare-faced and impudent in their Vices,<note place="margin">chap. 5. 7.</note>
that good and prudent Men thought fit to <hi>keep silence in
that Time, because it was an evil Time.</hi> For all these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
the Prophets threaten with them a Captivity,<note place="margin">chap. 5. 13.</note> and
other severe Judgments; and that because <hi>God had known
them only of all the Families of the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">chap. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>therefore he would
punish them for their Iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Words I have read, he says, <hi>I have overthrown you,
(some</hi> is not in the Hebrew) <hi>as God did</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah.
<hi>As,</hi> does not import in the Scripture-Phrase
an exact resemblance, but only some Similitude in general.
So that it does not necessarily import, that Fire came
down from Heaven on them, but that they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
totally, perhaps by Fire, Thundring, or Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
The <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast</hi> understood it more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and rendred it thus: <hi>The Word of the Lord abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, as he did</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You were as a Firebrand, pluck'd out of the Burning.</hi> A
proverbial Form of Speech, either expressing the great
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65703:7"/>
Danger they had run, with the extraordinary Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
they had met with,<note place="margin">Zech. 3. 2.</note> God rescuing them on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;<note place="margin">Iude 23.</note>
as also the despicableness of their present Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
since nothing looks worse than a Firebrand snatch'd
out of the Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet have you not returned unto me, saith the Lord.</hi> They
continued in their Impieties, and irreligious Worship, in
their Separation from their right way of worshipping
God at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in their Luxury, Sensuality, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice:
and all the Judgments they had felt, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might have a little awakened them, when they lay
under them, had not any such effect, as to turn their
Hearts, or to change the Course of their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee,</hi> O Israel; <hi>and because
I will do thus unto thee. Thus,</hi> may either relate to the
former Judgments, as if they were to be repeated upon
them; or to what follows of the Captivity threatned in
the beginning of the next Chapter, <hi>The Virgin of Israel
being fallen, and not able to rise;</hi> Ten being left of an
Hundred, and a Hundred of a Thousand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prepare thee to meet thy God, O Israel.</hi> This is either
an Ironical Alarm to them, to see what they could do to
resist that God, the God of Hosts, that formed the
Mountains, created the Wind, knew the Secret of Mens
Hearts, could bring Darkness on the Earth in a bright
Sun-shine, and tread upon the high Places of the Earth,
the great Powers and mighty Empires, at his Pleasure:
they were to try how they were able to resist his Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to bind up the Clouds, or the Winds of Heaven,
or to disperse those Armies that he was to send against
them; whom he would inspire with great Courage, when
they should be struck with pannick Fear, and such Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and dejection of Mind, that all their Songs should
be turned to Lamentations. Or this, <hi>Prepare thee to meet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65703:7"/>
thy God,</hi> is an Invitation to Repentance, as that which
could only avert those Judgments that were ready to
break forth on them, and dissipate the Clouds; so that
instead of the Storms they had reason to look for, they
might be bless'd with a serene Calm, and entire Peace,
upon their returning to God.</p>
            <p>Having thus opened the Scope and Intention of the
Prophet in the Text, I shall now speak to these four
Particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. When we have met with Judgments, signal, both in
their kind, and in the deliverance out of them, we
ought to remember God's hand in them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
for what ends he both laid them on, and took
them off.</item>
               <item>II. We ought to consider, what effect these have had
on us? Whether they have made us turn to God,
or not?</item>
               <item>III. We are to consider, how much severer Judgments
we may reasonably look for, if those that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come upon us, have not prevailed to make
us return to God.</item>
               <item>IV. Upon all this, we ought to look unto God, and
to endeavour to prevent that which we cannot
otherwise avoid or resist, by an unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the First of these: If we believe, that the World
is governed by a Supreme Providence, we must conclude,
that more astonishing and extraordinary Events, not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65703:8"/>
only fall not out by chance, but are directed for some
great ends, proportioned to such means. If either an
Accident, or a Combination of cursed Men, first kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this Fire, yet the Wind that waited on it, and drive
it forward with such violence, that neither the many
Hands that were employed to quench it, the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of so much Water, the Engines used, and all the
other Means that could be thought on, were effectual to
stop its Rage, till it had done its Work, was a manifest
Indication of the Hand of God it. And how much soever
Mens thoughts may be now blunted on this Subject, yet
then, as I have understood from those that saw it, there
were few that look'd on, that seemed not touched with
the apprehensions of God's displeasure. Many that were
not immediatly concerned in it, yet smote on their Breasts,
and said, <hi>This is of God, let us return to Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not enlarge on the Description of it, or of the
unexpected stopping of it in many places, even in the
midst of very combustible Matter; so that the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it had almost as manifest Characters of a Divine
Appointment on it, as the Conflagration it self. It would
very ill become one that saw it not, to spend much Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
about it to those that saw it, and as it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
will never forget it, but will tell it to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Age; as God commanded the <hi>Israelites</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
down to Posterity, the remembrance of the Captivity
they had groaned under in <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the signal Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of it: for things of so extraordinary a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ought never to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>I know it is not sit, upon every Calamity to enter into
the Secrets of God's Providence, nor to determine what
were, and were not the procuring Causes: or what were
the more principal ones. In these Cases men of several
Parties, have always found out somewhat in which they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65703:8"/>
thought themselves least concerned, and have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to load that with the whole burthen of God's Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and so upon this occasion, Men have not been
wanting to assign such Causes, as might make those from
whom they differed more hateful. But who has said,
<hi>What have I done?</hi> And indeed, tho we may err in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
one thing more than another drew down this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on us, and in the enumeration of the Causes of it,
may fail in the Account; yet it is certain, that when we
lay them all together, and more particularly reflect on
such of them, wherein we find our selves most concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
we are in the readiest way to prevent the like, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
Judgments, from coming on us for the future. It were
also a vain and bold Presumption in any, to enquire into
this Secret, Why this City more than others, or these parts
of it more than others, were burnt down? Our Saviour,
by his Answer upon the like occasion, concerning those
whose Blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mixed with their Sacrifices, or those
on whom the Tower of <hi>Siloah</hi> fell, takes all Men off
from such Curiosities, suggesting to them a more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Meditation: <hi>I tell you, Nay; but except ye repent, ye
shall all likewise perish.</hi> In general,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 3, 5.</note> we are certain that
God afflicts us not willingly; and so, without a more
particular enquiry, we may conclude, that there were
great reasons for this awakening Dispensation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
instead of looking backward any longer, I now
proceed to the Second Point, to examine, What effects
this or the like Providences have produced upon us?
And whether we have returned to the Lord, or not?</p>
            <p>I shall confine my Discourse to those three Heads on
which the Prophet founds his Charge, Irreligion, Luxury,
and Vnrighteousness; and shall desire you to bear with
the Plainness, which becomes such a subject and sombere
Occasion. I cannot say upon the first Head, of Religion,
that the chief part of the Prophet's Accusation <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65703:9"/>
us: for the Sins of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> do not belong unto us;
we have not set up a new Way of Religion, different
from that appointed by God; we have not bin guilty of
any open Idolatry, in worshipping the Works of Mens
hands, or of making any resemblance of that invisible
Being, whom we adore. But in the Head of Religion, I
shall name other things, wherein we have bin as far from
returning to God, as the Ten Tribes were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First;</hi> They minded nothing but the external Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry,
the Musick, and other outward Performances,
and were weary often of these, so that their solemn Days
were Abominations to God. And now, if we look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our selves, tho there may be perhaps more Care in
this great City, than in any of the World, about the
decent Observation of the Sabbath; this is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Glory, who do so carefully restrain the Violation
of that holy Time; yet many of those, who in compliance
with Custom go to Church, do it meerly for Form. But if
we examine what these Assemblies amount to, for the
greatest part, we cannot think but God abhorrs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises
them. Many go to them only for Custom; others,
to shew their vain Apparel, and dress themselves with
such gawdy Pomp, as if it were a Play, rather than the
Worship of God, they went to bear a share in. I speak
not against modest Decency and Cleanness; but the vanity
of many Peoples Dress is no small Scandal to our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
who not only gratify their own Pride, but do all
they can to distract and tempt others.</p>
            <p>In the Worship of God, how little serious are we in all
the parts of it? We confess our Sins without Contrition, we
pray without Devotion, we praise God without Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we hear the Scriptures without Faith: So in a word,
all is but Form, and even of that we grow soon weary.
Any Excuse serves us, either to be absent, or to come
late. The too visible coldness of most People behaviour
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65703:9"/>
shew, their Hearts join not with their Bodies or their Lips
in the Worship of God. For Sermons, they are hearkened
to, as other Discourses are, which we either censure or
commend, as we see cause, or perhaps sleep all the while:
But if we do mind them, it is for most part rather to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
our selves with some Notion, to maintain Discourse,
and to gratify our Vanity, than to be truly edified by
them. And what we hear that more immediatly concerns
our selves, we put off, perhaps, with a slight Groan, and
may be say within our selves, <hi>God be merciful to us, we are
all Sinners.</hi> Do we think God is pleased or can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with such Assemblies?</p>
            <p>For the two Sacraments, the Devotion of the one is
almost quite gone, it becomes a matter of Entertainment,
and is used as a Ceremony that brings much Cost with it;
the Sponsors considering more the Fees they are to give,
than the Vows they make; and these being so slightly
made, no wonder they are slightly performed. It is true,
the other Sacrament is kept up with a little more serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
some more Preparation and Devotion, but because
People are a little apprehensive of this, many take the
best course they can to ease themselves of it, and do not
receive in many years, unless the Law of the Land make
it necessary, which is by too many more considered than
the Laws of Christ in his holy Gospel. If we sum all these
together, and reflect on the Coldness and Deadness we
are all guilty of, in our Religion and religious Worship,
can we think that we have yet <hi>returned to the Lord?</hi>
Can such a dead lifeless way of serving him, be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him, that knows how far our Hearts are from him,
when we draw near to him with our Lips? Can he take
pleasure in these Assemblies, which, as all Forms must be,
that are not enlivened by an internal Devotion, grow
burdensom to our selves; and are only kept up as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
either to Custom, or some Remainder of a natural
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65703:10"/>
Religion, that we have not been able to extinguish quite in
our Consciences, after many Attempts made to fear them?</p>
            <p>But to all this it may be opposed, Are not we zealous
for the Reformation? Sure all this Heat and Flame must
rise from true Religion? I deny not, but this great City
has been on all occasions very forward in expressing their
Zeal for the Reformation; but even upon this Head,
God has not a few things to charge us with. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us of a Zeal of a far higher Strain, than I am afraid
ours rises to,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 2.</note> even of <hi>giving ones Body to be burnt;</hi> which
yet would profit nothing, if it flowed not from true <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
So if our Heat about Religion rise not from a true
and internal Love to it, God may make it useful to others,
but it shall avail us nothing. The Corruptions of true
Religion, in all Times, have risen from this, That those
who would not submit to the necessary, but hard and
difficult parts of it, have studied to cheat themselves, and
if they could, to bribe God, by setting up in room of
these, some more easy and pompous things, which their
Circumstances qualified them for, and they have spent
much of their Wealth and Heat upon these. Some have
adorned Churches, and adulterated several parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
by the Splendor they have added to them: Some
have been very exact in external Performances; others
have taken pleasure even in rigors on themselves; and
others have been active and zealous in that Cause, which
they took to be the Cause of God. According to the
difference of Mens Constitutions, so they have chosen va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Ways, that did most sute with their Tempers, and
by a great Zeal about these, have pacified those Clamors,
which otherwise are apt to arise in a guilty Conscience.
The Sanguine love Pageantry; the Flegmatick, the dull
return of their Forms; the Melancholy affect Severities;
and the Cholerick are peevish and passionate, and think
those Heats that are natural to them, are Sacrifices of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65703:10"/>
great value with God. But will he accept of these from such
defiled hands?</p>
            <p>I know, those that are inwardly possessed with the Love of God
and their Neighbour, and have a just sense of the Love their
Redeemer hath shewed them, must have a very lively concern
in those things that relate to his Glory, and the Salvation of our
Souls. But if we only put on a heat, and counterfeit a Zeal,
where there is no good Principle under it, this is but to mock
God, and think to pay him with false Coin, because it has the
superscription of the true. If our Zeal is only Passion or Faction,
then to offer this up to God, is to bring wild-Fire, and kindle
it on his Altar.</p>
            <p>There are two sad Indications, that declare the Zeal of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part is no better: The one is, that the rest of their Lives are
not of a piece with their Zeal. It is an impudent thing for any
to pretend, that he is concerned that others should glorify God,
when he is so ready to dishonour him himself; or that the sincere
Belief, or pure Way of Worship, may be preserved, when he
so cares, as if he neither believed in his Heart, nor worshipped
God in his Spirit. God is not mocked, but discerns through all
our Disguises, the secret Thoughts and Intents of our Hearts. I
speak not this to cool or lessen your Zeal for the Reformation,
but to direct it aright, that it being fixed on a better Principle
than either Passion or Interest, may have a deeper root, and a
stronger operation, may be more acceptable with God, and more
effectual by his Blessing: which cannot be expected to hypocritical
Pretences, or at best, the Fermentation of Revenge or Interest.</p>
            <p>Another sad Symptom, that shews our Zeal about Religion is
not what it ought to be, appears in these unnatural Heats, that
grow every day among our selves, for things, of which, to speak
modestly, a Man must say, they deserve not that warmth which
we bestow on them. If a Man is so far free from the Contagion
which most are infected with, by being of a Party, as to consider
the things themselves, he cannot but stand amazed, to see Men,
who agree in all the Substantials of Religion, quarrel so violently
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65703:11"/>
about some external and less important Matters, when the Enemy
is at the Gates. It was one of the clearest Demonstrations of the
Wrath of God on <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that during their last Siege, the
Factious were so high within, that as they had any respite from
the Enemy without, they were destroying one another. They
would not know the things that belonged to their Peace in time,
and so they were hid from their Eyes in the day of their Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When the <hi>African</hi> Churches were ready to be devoured
by the <hi>Vandals,</hi> who besides the Barbarity of their Tempers, were
<hi>Arrians</hi> by their Religion; The Schism of the <hi>Donatists</hi> did so
rage, and was managed with such heat, too much of both Sides,
as St. <hi>Austin</hi> laments,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. con Parm. cap. 7. lib. 3. con Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. c. 49, 50.</note> that it was a manifest Sign of their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ruine; yet that holy Father, with the other Bishops of that
time, made great Offers for comprehending the <hi>Donatists</hi> within
the Unity of the Church; one was, to take them into a share of
their Functions, and that the Surviver should be the sole Pastor.
But secular Men enflamed the Differences, and the Governors
punished the <hi>Donatists</hi> so severely, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> wrote often
to them,<note place="margin">Epist. 60, 127, 158, 159, 160.</note> to stop these violent Proceedings. But that holy Man
died, while <hi>Hippo</hi> was besieged, and the Prop of these Churches
being removed, they soon became a Prey to their cruel Enemies,
who brought them all under a most terrible and undistinguish'd
Persecution.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Impiety, and <hi>Saracen</hi> Empire, was spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the East, the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire fell into such Divisions and
Animosities about the Will of Christ, and the Use of Images, that
disjointed them one from another, and made way for the growth
of <hi>Mahometanism.</hi> Shall we follow these Patterns so carefully, as
if we were afraid to miss such Calamities as fell on them? Are we
so little sensible of the Advantages we give our Enemies, and the
weakning we bring upon our selves, by such Jealousies and Heart-burnings.
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> following their just Law-Suits
before Unbelievers, brought thereby a Scandal on Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
charged them <hi>rather to suffer Wrong,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>than that a Brother should
go to Law with a Brother.</hi> If such things, which had a foundation in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65703:11"/>
Justice and Property, were to be forborn for their Indecency;
O how much more reasonable is it now for those who publish the
glad Tidings of Peace, to lift up their Voices as a Trumpet, to
sound a Retreat from this ungodly War in our Church, and to
call Men off from their unseasonable Heats, to a greater Calm
and Temper, when the Effects of them are like to be so fatal.</p>
            <p>It has been the Device of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> both to keep
Unity within her self, and to foment Differences among others,
ever since the Reformation. They have Differences among them
of a far higher nature than any we have among us. The most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Differences in Matters of Doctrine, that have raised the
greatest Animosities in this Island, have been about the Nature of
Divine Grace, and the Order of the Decrees of God: but those
have been carried as high, if not higher, in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
I need not mention the many Differences among the several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the Schoolmen, who have invented various Explanations
of almost all the Mysteries of their Religion, and have defended
their Sentiments with as little Modesty of Language, as many of
our Writers do; yet all this has not broken their Church. In that
which is to them the fundamental Point of their Religion, <hi>Where
the supreme Power of judging Controversies infallibly is lodged;</hi> tho
they all agree against us, that there must be a living infallible
Judg, yet they do not agree in whom this Power is placed. Many
set up the Pope; others are so ashamed of this, that they are for
the Council, without the Pope; and others chuse a middle way,
and are for ascribing it to the Pope and Council together: And
yet if the Council has either the Infallibility entirely, or has any
share in it, so that it is no-where without its concurence,
then they have no infallible Judg, it being 115 years since they
had a General Council, and 'tis like to be much longer before
mother comes.</p>
            <p>I need not enlarge on their other Differences, either the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter
Contests concerning the Immaculate Conception of the
B. Virgin, which were not only supported by ordinary Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but by Pretences to Visions aud Revelations; and the later
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65703:12"/>
Contests, that are yet depending at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Morals of the Jesuits, and other modern Casuists: All
these shew the Varieties among them in Matters of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Those who have travelled among them, and narrowly observ'd
their Customs, see that there are no small Diversities in the Rites
and Forms of their Worship. Every Nation, and every Religious
Order, has some Rites that are peculiar to them; and tho the
<hi>Roman</hi> Office is now used most commonly, yet as the <hi>Ambrosian</hi>
continued long at <hi>Millain,</hi> and the <hi>Mozarabick</hi> in some parts of
<hi>Spain;</hi> so here in <hi>England,</hi> the Southern Parts followed the Use
of <hi>Sarum;</hi> the Northern, the Use of <hi>York; South-Wales,</hi> the
Use of <hi>Hereford;</hi> and <hi>North-Wales,</hi> the Use of <hi>Bangor;</hi> besides
a peculiar Use that <hi>Lincoln</hi> had for that large Diocess. All which
shew how willing they were to knit all People to their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
indulging them some peculiar Rites, either different from,
or added to the rest. So well have they studied the Policy of
keeping their whole Strength united together, against those they
call Hereticks, and their common Enemies; tho they have not
been able to bring all their Votaries to an Uniformity, either in
Points of Doctrine, or the Forms of Worship.</p>
            <p>They have no less industriously blown upon and improved all
the Differences among the Reformed, to break them among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Could so small a matter, as the Difference about the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ in the Sacrament, (which was only a speculative
part, since their Worship did not differ,) have so divided the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>
and <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches, if some secret Practices of theirs
had not wrought on the Weakness and Passions of some angry
Men? The <hi>Papists</hi> saw this as well on the one hand, as the Princes
and soberer Divines perceived it on the other. At one Publick
Conference,<note place="margin">Hist. of the Council of Trent. <hi>lib 5. Anno</hi> 1557.</note> appointed by the Diet of the Empire, between <hi>Papists</hi>
and <hi>Protestants,</hi> for setling Religion, the <hi>Papists</hi> knowing their
weak Side, and desirous to throw a Bone among them, proposed,
that they should first agree to condemn the <hi>Helvetians. Melancthon</hi>
perceived what this aimed at, and so studied to divert it; but
other peevish Divines grew so hot about it, that they broke up the
Meeting, to the no small joy of the Popish Party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65703:12"/>
How far they may have practised among us to inflame
our Differences, I shall not determine: but I am sure
there is nothing we can possibly contrive, more both to
their Advantage and Satisfaction, than this is. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philosophers had different Schools, but worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in the same Temples. The Primitive Christians
differed in many Customes, both about the Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Lent,</hi> with many other various Rites;
but they never broke that Bond of Peace and Perfection,
the Unity of the Church, till the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to lay their Yoke upon the other Churches. It
were a great happiness to be exactly of the same mind:
and such as differ from the Publick Constitution, ought
certainly to examine the ground of these Differences,
with calm and unprejudiced minds: And, to pronounce
my own Opinion freely, and without reserves, I am
very confident if that were done, with the Care and
Application that is requisite, the Truth would soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be of our Church's side: and if there be yet any
Defects in our Constitution, or any thing that requires
Amendment or Improvement; as, no doubt, none ever
was since the Apostles dayes that needed it not; then
let clear Reason, and calm, but steady Endeavours be
used for compleating or ordering what is wanting or
amiss among us; which His late Glorious Majesty offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to redress, for setling this Church. And it will seem
strange, if any who glory so much, and so justly, in
the Honour the Church received by so great a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
as his Martyrdom gave it, should not follow
those Thoughts, which He, after a long course of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and deep and devout study about them, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up; a due difference being made between the
things that he offered in compliance to the heat of that
time, and the more retired Reflections himself had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65703:13"/>
But if so great a Happiness, as a compleat, Unity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be attained to, let us, at least, lay aside our Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
Unchristian, and unpolitick Animosities; conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
to the Infirmities of the Weak, and pitying them
rather than insulting over them: Let such mutual al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
be given as Humane Infirmity, the weakness
of many mens Reasons, the strength of their Passions,
and the force of Prejudice and Education require.
And if we will so order our Zeal, that its first and
chief Operation be on our selves, reforming our Lives,
and purifying our Hearts, and then apply it propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to other things, giving to every part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
such a share of it as the importance of the thing
requires; then a great deal of our heat would be soon
allayed.</p>
            <p>But to speak plainly; Is it a Christian Zeal to disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Lies and Scandals? To expose men that have
deserved highly, for some supposed Mistakes? These
things ought not so to be. If those that run about
with the greatest violence, blowing on such sparks,
would examine themselves, as in the presence of God,
what is the secret cause or spring of all their Motions,
I am sure much of it will be found to flow from <hi>bitter
Envy and Strife,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames 3. 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>which bring on Confusion and every evil
work: and not from the Wisdom that is from above, and
is first pure and then peaceable, and easie to be entreated.</hi>
And as we <hi>ought in meekness instruct those oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 25.</note>
so others should not express too great uneasiness
at the Instructions we offer them.</p>
            <p>If we will reflect on the high value our Saviour set
on our loving one another,<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 35.</note> that thereby <hi>all men should
know that we are his Disciples,</hi> it would soon change our
Temper; so that being ashamed of our former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests,
if we could not of a sudden come to think the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65703:13"/>
same things; yet the same Spirit of Meekness, Humility
and Charity dwelling in us, we should soon grow up
into one Body: from which we are not kept, so much
by the Differences themselves that we dispute about, as
by that Alienation of Mind, which hath so violently
rent us from one another. And this makes that for all
the Evils which we have either felt, or do still fear,
instead of accusing or condemning our selves, we lay
the blame wholly upon others. The City blames the
Country, and the Country the City: We of the Church
blame those of the Separation, and they of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
blame us of the Church: But alas! who look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own Consciences, and humble themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God!</p>
            <p>This Evil is of the Lord, therefore let us turn to
him with our whole Heart: and we shall certainly feel,
that as a Spirit of true and real Holiness rises in us, we
shall grow above these Contests for small matters. For
God seems to punish us with this division of Language
and Heart, as he did the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> for our
other sins; since without a stroke from Heaven, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
measure of Infatuation could not carry this so
far.</p>
            <p>And now I go to the next particular charged by the
Prophet on these Tribes, wherein they had not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the Lord: That was <hi>Luxury.</hi> They had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built
their Houses, furnished them gloriously, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
themselves with their Plenty: which they abused
by their excessive Intemperance, both in eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and in other Jollities; being insensible of the
Judgments of God, that had either fallen on them, or
were hanging over them. And in this, how parallel
are our Sins to theirs? This City is rebuilt with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Luxury, as well as Order and Beauty: How
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65703:14"/>
many do exceed their Rank and Condition, the many
Breakings do too manifestly declare: few are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to live in that moderate Frugality and Decency that
their Ancestors used; and complain of want and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of Trade, because there comes not in enough to
supply their Vanities, or to serve their Luxury. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
that abounds is too notorious to be much
insisted on: as if those Liquors which God hath bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
us with, for refreshing and restoring our Spirits,
were to be used either for the inflaming of our Lusts,
the depressing our Reasons, impairing our Healths, and
the profuse wasting of our Time and Estates. Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
also must be fallen on for the decent forcing others
to the like Excesses, by setting Healths about. A pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
so ridiculously Brutal, that it were a loss of words
to go to expose it: Hereby men are not satisfied to
Gratifie their own Intemperance, but most lay snares
for others. And how studiously do these Agents for
Vice, endeavour to corrupt all that are so unhappy
as to fall in their ill Company; training them on by
degrees, till they have raised them to the like pitch of
Impiety with themselves. To this is joyned the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and Curiosity of Entertainments, which has been
long accounted one of the special Vices of this City.
Our Bodies when nourished in the most moderate
manner, and kept down with Exercise, yet are apt
enough to raise many Temptations in us: which we
ought not to cherish, by laying in a too plentiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for the Flesh, with its Lusts and Affections.
When People give themselves up to all the incentives
to Lust, and by Jollities, Musick, Balls, Drinking and
Feasting, have laid themselves out to so many Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and prepared so much fewel within for these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
Flames to work on; it is no wonder that all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65703:14"/>
of Riot and wantonness should follow such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.
The Indecencies of both Sexes going to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,
the corruption of a defiled Stage, the gross Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
which many take, have now run us into such a
mire of Filth and Sensuality, that it is scarce decent to
rake in that kennel: and to speak of the things that
are done, alas, not in secret, but in the sight of the
Sun; <hi>Shall not God visit for these things?</hi> Have we yet
returned unto him? or do we not go on to dare Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and work all manner of Abominations with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness.
And while such Vices abound, and so many
Judgments hang over us, who is betaking himself to
Fasting and Prayer? who hath cut off any of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Excesses, or is accusing himself? Sin and Lewdness
are still growing, and its like will go on, till, as the
Prophet threatens, <hi>God shall make your Sun to go down
at Noon, and darken the Earth in the clear day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">8 ch. 9, 10, ver.</note> Poetical
Expressions for unlook'd for Miseries. <hi>Then he will turn
your Feasts unto mourning, and all your Songs unto La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations:</hi>
and instead of the vanities of your Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and the costly dresses on your Heads, <hi>will bring
Sackcloth on all your loyns, and baldness on all your heads,
and make your mourning to be like the mourning of an only
Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing for which the Prophet accuses the
ten Tribes, is, that which Luxury must carry with it,
to support it; their <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Oppression.</hi> A man
that spends profusely on himself, as he disables himself
from giving the Poor such a share of his Wealth as he
ought to do; so he grows unable to perform those
stricter Duties of Justice and Equity to his Neighbours
with whom he deals. Men that will live high, must
maintain it by all possible means: If the cheating, even
a Friend, the Sophisticating corrupted Goods, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65703:15"/>
Creditors, by covering one with some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or pretending he breaks to force Abatements of
just Debts, or perhaps the profuse wasting both his
own Stock, and the Stocks with which others have
trusted him, become necessary to furnish out his Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury
and Vanity, he sticks at none of them. I do not
doubt but the Regulations made in this great City are
as exact and well considered as in any such City
in the World; but as long as the high way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
continues, many unrighteous things must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
for defraying that Expence. Justice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
are among the first Elements of Virtue,
which Nature does so early teach all men; and are so
necessary to the Peace and Government of the World,
that we do very impudently pretend to the high things
of Religion, if we have not begun with these, which
are the lowest steps to it. If Trade is carried on by
Lying, Cheating, Sophisticating, Extortion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regulated
Usury, can a Blessing be expected from
Heaven, on Wealth so acquired? If men make <hi>their
Weights small,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8 ch. 5, 6, 8, ver.</note> 
               <hi>and falsifie their Balances by Deceit, so
that they sell the Poor bread, shall God forget these things?
shall not the Land tremble for this and every one mourn
that dwelleth therein?</hi> If the Mystery of some Trades
consists in the Cheats of them; if Retailing is manag'd
by lying, if Debts are paid by cousenage and fraud, if
Bargains are made after too much Wine hath nummed or
overheated the Spirits of the one Party, of which the
other takes advantage; if men have ever so much
wealth and cunning both in acquiring and preserving
it; yet according to the Prophetical expressions in
the Ninth Chapter,<note place="margin">9 ch. 2, 3, ver.</note> 
               <hi>Though they dig unto Hell God will
take them thence, and though they climb up unto Heaven he
will bring them down, though they hide themselves on the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65703:15"/>
tops of Mountains, he will search and take them out from
thence, and if they should lie as close as in the Bottom of the
Sea, he will command a Serpent to bite them.</hi> In these
Points we ought on such days of Humiliation, if we
intend not to add the Mockery of these to our other
Sins, to examine our selves, as in the Presence of God,
and see whether we have either departed from our old
Sins, or instead of doing that, do not only continue
in them, but contract new Guilt. If we will break the
Yokes of Oppression and Injustice, if we convert what
formerly went to our Luxury and Vanity, and apply
it to the Necessity of our poor Brethren; and if instead
of these Forms (in the repeating which we have too
long placed all our Religion) and of our bitter Heats,
we do follow <hi>Peace with all men, and Holiness, without
which no man shall see the Lord:</hi> then when we pray to
him, he will hear our Prayers, <hi>our Light shall shine out
under all</hi> that Darkness, that now covers us; <hi>God shall
guide us continually, and so satisfie our Souls, that we shall
delight our selves in him and his Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we will still continue in our Sins, and satisfie
our selves with so slight a way of serving God, then
we may look for either the like, or heavier Judgments:
which is the third thing I proposed to speak to; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thus will I do unto thee.</hi> All the Corrections that God
lays on us, are to amend us, but if these prevail not,
then other severer means must be used for the same
end, more searching Medicines when gentler ones can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
raise or carry off the Humours; and in Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
God often makes those Nations on whom he had
bestowed the most discriminating Marks of his Favour,
the most publick Instances of his Justice, as he did the
<hi>Iews</hi> of old, for their Idolatry, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
after they had so strangely corrupted the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65703:16"/>
more signal Judgments being perhaps the only
Means left to work on some, whom indulgent Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
do not prevail with; who indeed can be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
by nothing, but Thunder and Lightning. In
the Government of the World, the Methods of divine
Providence are so mysterious, that it very ill becomes
us, to take on us to judge how things shall fall out: yet
since <hi>Solomon</hi> has observed that there is nothing new
<hi>under the Sun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 9.</note> and by what has been, we may collect
what may be; there are two things threatned by this
Prophet; <hi>a Famine, not of Bread, nor a Thirst for Water,
but of hearing the Word of the Lord: so that they should
wander from Sea to Sea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8 ch. 11. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and run to and fro to seek it, but
should not find it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">9 ch. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The other was, that they should go unto
Captivity before their Enemies, where God should command
the Sword that it should slay them, and he would set his Eyes
on them for Evil and not for Good.</hi> It is worth our
time to consider what we may expect either of these
ways.</p>
            <p>As for a Famine of the Word of the Lord, whether
it shall come upon us, from that Religion, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
professes its Design to be to take the Scripture out
of the hands of the People, or from any other hand;
we have Reason enough to look for it, when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how horridly we have neglected and abused it.
The greatest part never trouble themselves about it,
and, perhaps, since their first Education and Child-hood,
have never looked on it; others have read it, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it more carefully in their Memories, but rather that
by talking in that Stile, they may conceal their Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
and by the Misapplication of it, excuse their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Faults: but how few read it with a plain Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of mind, to receive Instruction and Light from
it, and to kindle greater Warmth of Affection in them,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65703:16"/>
from the many excellent Passages in it: which, what
Effect soever they may have on vulgar Readers, are, to
those that read them, with a well disposed Mind, strong
and sharp as a two edged Sword. It cannot be denyed
but Religion, among us, has lost much of its Force and
Authority, and many, seeing thorough the Hypocrisie
of one sort, and the Formality of another, have come
to imagine, that there is nothing in it but either Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
or Interest. And I wish the great Scandals that
our Contests have given to all men of clear and disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
Reasons, may not have occasioned or encreased
this in a great Measure. Universally the Gospel is
preached and heard without that Sense, which a thing
of such high Consequence deserves; for certainly, it
must be acknowledged, that either Christianity is a
Contrivance or Dream, or that it is the most important
thing in the World. How farr other Accidents may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of this, of which the Force and Efficacy is, in a
great part, gone, we do not know: whether down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Atheism, or the Disbelief of all revealed Religion,
which has got such footing among us; or other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Conceits of extirpating a Gospel-Ministry, as the
decentest Introduction to these, may not bring us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Curse, I shall not play the Diviner: but the great
rage by which many endeavour to make the Clergy
hateful and contemptible, with a Concurrence of some
other things, seems to give just Apprehensions, that we
may live yet to see such days.</p>
            <p>I confess, on the other hand, the Appearances seem
more probable and threatning, that we shall be brought
under the Tyranny of that Church, that can never hope
to advance her Interests, but by suppressing this Light,
by prohibiting the Scriptures, and persuading the
World to deliver up their Faith and Conscience to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65703:17"/>
keeping and governing of their Priests; for who can
go over to them, till his Mind is so loaded with Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that he dares not use his Understanding and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Can any man believe that a Bishop, chosen with
all the craft and intrigue that can be used among the
cunningest Statesmen in the World, should be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Head of the Church, the Universal Pastor, St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Successor, and the Supreme Judge of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies?
who though he understand no Divinity, and
practises as little Morality, yet must decide all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of Religion; and that in his Sentence all must
acquiesce. He that can believe this, is well enough pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to go over to them, and to believe the onely
thing I know, which is more incredible; that a Priest,
by vertue of a Character given him, which is every
whit as unintelligible as this great Effect of it, can, by
pronouncing of five words, make a piece of Bread and
a little Wine, become the whole and entire Substance
of the Body and Blood of Christ; so that it is all in
every crumb and drop of it. These are things to which
men must be long and well prepared, before they can
think they believe them: for it may be justly made a
Question, whether they do, or indeed can believe
them? This Religion must of necessity, for its own
support, extinguish the Light of the Scriptures: in
which, the part that came more immediately, than any
other, from God himself, has not escaped their Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:
I mean, the ten Commandments; of which,
the Second, one of the fullest and most copious of
them is left out of their Catechismes: because it must
have cleansed the Churches of Images, and the many
other Monuments of Idolatry, with which they had
defiled it. And in the New Testament, that part of it
on which they have built most, is yet so contrary to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65703:17"/>
one of their Devices, that it was fit for them not to let
the People understand it. I mean the Institution of
the Eucharist, in which Christ said, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi>
when he gave his Disciple the Cup. They had also
made their Worship so ridiculous, by the many strange
Legends read on the Saints dayes, to which both the
Collects and Anthems for these Offices do relate, that
it had been hard to have brought the Pople to hear
these things gravely: Therefore it was very fit, for these
ends, to have their Worship in an unknown Tongue:
though St. <hi>Paul</hi> has written so copiously on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note>
that it is not easie to imagine how their minds are
composed, who believe that he was inspir'd, and yet
approve of a Worship, in a Language not understood
by the People.</p>
            <p>But after all these Corruptions of theirs, why should
we not think it reasonable to believe, that since we
have given our selves up to some of the worst Effects
of Popery, God should abandon us so far, as to suffer
us to come again under that yoke, from which, by a
mighty hand, he delivered our Fathers? While we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him merely out of Form, what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that and the <hi>telling of Beads?</hi> If we think a loose
Life may, by a few touches of Sorrow, be so expiated,
that these shall carry us to Heaven, is not this almost
as bad as to believe <hi>Attrition is sufficient to Salvation?</hi>
If we think our coming to Church, or Sacrament, will
save us, is it not as bad as their <hi>Opus operatum?</hi> If we
blindly deliver our selves up to a Party, and follow all
its Interests, what better is this than their <hi>Implicit Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</hi>
and if we allow our selves in that rage and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
by which many carry on their Opinions, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ruin of all who differ from them, and spare no
Methods, how false or cruel soever they be; This is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65703:18"/>
not far from their <hi>Extirpating of Hereticks, and saying,
there is no Faith to be kept to them.</hi> If by these and many
more particulars, we examine how much the Spirit of
Popery doth still leaven us, many of these who seem
most heartily opposite to it, will be found deeply tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
with it: And if we are secretly corrupted with
some of the worst Principles of that Religion before
we are aware of it, the other parts will more easily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Our Doctrine and Worship are <hi>Reformed:</hi> That
we owe to the last Age, and to our Educations: But if
our Hearts and Lives are vitiated by the same ill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
under another disguise, it will not be so great a
Leap as some men imagine to get over that Gulf.</p>
            <p>Here is one danger before us: it is a great one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and perhaps the very Methods some may use to
secure us from it, may precipitate us headlong unto it.
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> advised the <hi>Iews</hi> to kill our Saviour, fearing
that upon his pretending to be a King, the <hi>Romans</hi>
might come and take that place: But this did so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
God, that what they feared came upon them:
so whether some by overbending their Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
may not overthrow a Church, which has been,
ever since the Reformation began, the greatest Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
against Popery, and drive things much farther
than at present they intend or imagine, I leave it to the
thoughts of wiser men.</p>
            <p>The other thing threatned by the Prophet, is, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
led unto Captivity, and given up to the Sword. Our
present Wealth and Plenty, the Situation of our Countrey,
the strength of our Fleets, and the natural Bravery of the
Nation, may seem perhaps to raise us beyond the fear of
it: <hi>England</hi> never having been higher in Trade, our
Plantations never stronger and better Peopled, our
Dominions never more extended and our Shipping go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65703:18"/>
from under one end of Heaven to another. But
alas! if God blast our publick Counsels, and strike us
at home with such a Division of Heart, that we cannot
agree in things that are necessary for common Safety;
all our Wealth makes us but a more inviting Prey, either
for a <hi>Tyre</hi> or <hi>Sidon,</hi> that may be near us, who would
gladly carry our Trade from us; or for a great Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
that hovers over any of his Neighbours, to spye from
whence he can receive an Addition to his Empire and
<hi>Glory.</hi> And if God intends to give us up to Captivity,
he will take away the Heart from our Councellors, and
Spirit and Courage from our Armies and Fleets; as the
Prophets threatned the <hi>Israelites</hi> often, that those to
whom God was to deliver them up, should come upon
them with so unresistable a Force, and meet with so
faint an Opposition, that they should easily fall into
their hands.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in which the overruling Force of
divine Providence, shews it self more than in the rising
and falling of Empires; in which we find often, great
Kingdoms subdued by a small Force, while the one
were elevated with more than ordinary Courage, and the
other side, by a Series of odd Accidents, as much depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
so that vast Treasures and great Armies have melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to nothing; and sometimes without any visible
Fault in the Conduct; where no rational Account can
be given, but that Heaven was on the one side. If God
is against us, he needs no Instruments to chastise us
with, he can either by binding or opening the Clouds
or Winds of Heaven, blast all the Fruits of our Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
or Trade: he can bring out of the Dust of the
Earth, Swarms of Vermine to plague us; he can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his Arrows, and again send the Plague or a Fire
among us, or so give us up to Madness and Disorder,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65703:19"/>
that we shall again fall in unnatural Wars at home, and
destroy one another.</p>
            <p>Some of these Dangers are not so remote, as to be
look'd upon as the dark Dreams of melancholy men,
or the Speculations of a disturbed Fancy; what has been
may be, and is, perhaps, nearer than we imagine. I
shall not encrease your Horror at the Return of such
things, by a pompous and tragical Description of
them; you need but reflect on what you have seen
and known of many of them: and what if these shall
return upon us again? What if this fruitful and
peaceable Land, be again made a Field of Blood, and
be watered on both sides, by the Blood of <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
Brother fighting against Brother, till being thus
weakned at home, we become an easie Acquisition,
to those who long for such a Breach among our selves?
And does not the Prospect of these things affect us?</p>
            <p>What remains then, but that I conclude with the
fourth particular, of which I proposed to speak, that
our turning to God, is that which only can prevent those
Judgments that we cannot resist. There is no Council nor
Divination against God, he makes the Diviners mad,
and brings the Councils of the Heathen to nothing; he
makes the Devices of the people, of none effect: we
can neither withstand his Power, defeat his Wisdom,
nor escape his hand; we can only humble our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and turn to him with our whole Hearts; and
thereby avert all that storm of heavy Wrath, that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to burst out upon us. If there were a general turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the evil of our ways, from the Intemperance,
Uncleanness, Injustice, and Impieties, that have so long
prevailed among us; then how soon would all these
dreadful Symptomes of God's Displeasure fall off? Upon
the Repentance of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> those Judgments which were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65703:19"/>
so near, that the short period of forty dayes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
to them, were put off to a longer time: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
but feigned Humiliation of <hi>Ahab,</hi> procured to
him a Reprieve of that Sentence the Prophet had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.
So if there were but a ceslation from these
horrid Impieties by which God is so highly dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and of those publick and avowed Vices which no
Christian Nation practises now more openly than we
do; and which have, in a great measure, taken our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Sense from us; we might hope for a longer
continuance of that Tranquillity, which we still enjoy.
But if no warnings will prevail, if neither past Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
nor threatned Miseries, nor the sense which some,
who have gone in the same <hi>excess of Riot,</hi> have expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of it when they were near Death, will work on a
wicked generation, it seems such are already under
that Curse given in Commission to <hi>Esaias, Make the
Heart of this People fat,</hi>

               <hi>and make their Ears heavy, and
shut their Eyes; lest they see with their Eyes and hear with
their Ears, and understand with their Hearts, and convert
and be healed:</hi> and that this shall last till <hi>the Cities be
wasted without Inhabitants, the Houses without men, and
the Lord be utterly desolate.</hi> Words expressing the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
indignation possible against such Sinners, who had
long abused the Patience of God, and had mocked him,
by drawing near to him with their Lips when their
Hearts were far from him.</p>
            <p>But if the greatest part will still go on in their Sins,
till they perish by them; yet if there were but a small
number that would seriously set themselves to turn to
God, by Prayer, Fastings, Supplications, and engaging
in a course of strict and fervent Devotion, would stand
in that Breach which our Sins and Divisions have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and instead of looking after News, or expecting
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65703:20"/>
much from Humane Councils, till Gods Anger were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
would cry mightily to him; these might be the
happy Preservers and Deliverers of their Countrey, at
least from present Danger. Or if the Sins of <hi>England</hi>
are such, that God will not be entreated, even of these,
but will give such evidences of his Displeasure, that all
shall say, <hi>Verily there is a God that Iudges in the Earth,</hi>
yet such mourners shall not lose their labour: their
Tears and Prayers shall return upon themselves; they
shall at the least have their own Souls for a prey, and
may be blessed Instruments of gaining some few about
them; who, though they may be involved in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Calamity, yet shall find Mercy in the Day of the
Lord. God grant there may be many such among us,
and that for their sakes,<note place="margin">ch. 9. v 11.</note> 
               <hi>he may raise up the Tabernacle
of his Anointed, and close up the breaches of it, and build
it up as in the former times:</hi> and so establish us in this
good Land, which he hath given us, that we may still
enjoy the Blessings of his pure Religion and holy Word,
with the continuance of our Peace and Plenty: and
that if Evil be determined to come upon the Land,
that we may not see it, but may be gathered to our
Fathers in Peace. To God the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost, be all Honour and Glory, for ever
and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
